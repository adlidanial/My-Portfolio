                                Soccer Code is a mobile learning application that focused to introduce
                                the secondary students based on computational thinking skill concept.
                                The Soccer Code was the first of our team project under Diploma Final Year Project
                                at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. A team members such as Harith Imran, Amir Hamzah
                                and Ts. Dr. Ida Aryanie as my supervisor.

                                Soccer Code was using Adobe Animate CC to develop the mobile learning application and it was using ActionScript as a programming language
                                to add complex interactivity, playback control and data display in the mobile application. This mobile learning application took 4 month
                                to complete and implement the usability testing on the High School students from Batu Pahat.

                                IoT Based Smart Farming For Plant Disease Detection is a system based on the Internet of 
                                Things (IoT) and a Deep Learning method to develop the classification of plant diseases 
                                by using image processing. This IoT-based system was the second project of Final Year Project 
                                during the degree studies at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). The system provides an image capture module and pre-process by 
                                using Tensorflow to show the result of plant disease. The IoT-based solution integrated with 
                                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to help farmers identify the disease in advance 
                                and make a better decision on how to treat it.

                                The development of IoT Based Smart Farming For Plant Disease Detection by using Python as a programming language, Flask as a 
                                web framework written in Python and these project was running on Anaconda environment. The IoT device called ESP32-Camera to capture
                                the disease of leaf and the system showing the image captured. The Arduino software has been introduced to setup the connection 
                                between ESP-32 Camera with IoT-based system. The classification model using Tensorflow will be determined from the image either the plant disease or not.

                                Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). Sports and Recreation Exco from ITC has been proposed to create an event 
                                called Ketupat Virtual Run. As an exco members, I willingly to create a registration system for students, 
                                staff and outsiders to show the current of event that related to virtual run from ITC.
